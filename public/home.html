                <h2>Avoid Invasive, Plant Native!</h2>
                <p>Many big box stores and garden centers sell plants that may seem attractive but can become invasive in local ecosystems. Invasive species, once introduced, 
                  can outcompete native plants, disrupt habitats, and negatively impact biodiversity. It's crucial for consumers to be informed about the potential risks of purchasing and planting invasive species. 
                While these plants may be readily available and visually appealing, their introduction into gardens and landscapes can have long-term ecological consequences.
                By choosing native plants or non-invasive alternatives, gardeners and landscapers can help protect local environments and promote biodiversity. Awareness and responsible plant selection are key 
                in preventing the spread of invasive species and preserving our natural ecosystems.</p>

                <h2>Bee House Buzz</h2>
                <p>Bee houses, also known as bee hotels or bee habitats, are structures designed to provide nesting sites for solitary bees. These bees are vital pollinators and creating a suitable habitat can help support local ecosystems.</p>
            
                <h3>Requirements for Bee Houses</h3>
                <ul class="beehouse-facts">
                    <li><b>Placement:</b> Place bee houses facing east or southeast to receive morning sun and protect them from strong afternoon heat.</li>
                    <li><b>Location:</b> Install bee houses at a height of about 3-5 feet above ground level, securely fastened to a stable structure.</li>
                    <li><b>Protection:</b> Ensure bee houses are sheltered from strong winds and rain, ideally under an overhang or roof.</li>
                    <li><b>Materials:</b> Use natural materials such as untreated wood, bamboo, or reeds to create nesting tubes of varying diameters.</li>
                    <li><b>Maintenance:</b> Regularly clean and replace nesting materials to prevent mold and parasites, especially at the end of each season.</li>
                </ul>
